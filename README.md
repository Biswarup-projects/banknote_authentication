# 🔐 Bank Note Authentication

This project builds a machine learning model to classify whether a bank note is **genuine (0)** or **forged (1)** based on statistical features extracted from its image.

## 🔍 Objective
The goal of this notebook is to:
- Analyze the distribution of note features using statistical visualization
- Train a classification model to distinguish genuine and forged notes
- Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and feature importance

## 📂 Files
- `banknote_authentication.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full analysis, model training, and evaluation
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## 🚀 Highlights
- Clean data split and model training using Random Forest
- Statistical plots for feature distribution and importance
- ROC curve with threshold-based evaluation
- Final accuracy: **100%** with **0%** misclassification on test data
